# README Standards

> Required sections, structure, and content rules for project README files.
> Read when: creating or updating a project README, onboarding a new project, or reviewing README changes.

Every project must have a `README.md` at the repository root. The README is the primary onboarding document — a new developer should be able to clone the repo and have a working environment by following it.

### 1.1 Required Sections

Every project README must include the following sections in order:

| Section | Purpose |
| ------- | ------- |
| **Project overview** | Name, one-line description, what it does, who it's for |
| **Tech stack** | Languages, frameworks, database, key libraries — one line |
| **Development setup** | Two paths: Docker Compose and Conventional (see 1.2) |
| **Authentication** | How to sign in during development (SSO bypass, seed users, etc.) |
| **Third-party packages** | Table of key dependencies with purpose and docs link (see 1.4) |
| **Production** | How to build the production image, deployment target, environments, secrets (see 1.5) |
| **Project documentation** | Links to specs, ADRs, or other docs in the repo |

### 1.2 Development Setup — Two Paths

Every README must document two ways to run the application locally. Both paths must include every command needed from clone to running app.

**Path A: Docker Compose**

1. Prerequisites (Docker)
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`, fill in required values
3. `docker compose up --build`
4. Verify URL
5. How to run tests inside the container
6. How to connect to the compose database from host tools
7. How to stop and reset (`docker compose down`, `docker compose down -v`)

**Path B: Conventional (native runtime + standalone database)**

1. Prerequisites (language version, package manager)
2. Start the database using a standardized standalone container:
   ```bash
   docker run --name pg16 -p 5432:5432 -d --rm \
     -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres \
     -v ~/PostgresData/16:/var/lib/postgresql/data \
     postgres:16
   ```
3. Install dependencies (`bundle install`, `npm install`, etc.)
4. Set up the database (`db:create db:migrate db:seed`)
5. Start the application server
6. Start background workers (if applicable)
7. Reference `Procfile.dev` with Foreman/Overmind for running all processes at once
8. Run tests and linter commands

Rules:
- Every command must be in a code block — no prose-only instructions.
- Include the standalone database stop/start lifecycle (container uses `--rm`, data persists in `~/PostgresData/{version}/`).
- Path B is preferred for day-to-day development. Path A is preferred for onboarding and CI-like validation.

### 1.3 Project Overview

The overview section must include:

1. **Project name** as the H1 heading.
2. **One-line description** — what the app does in plain language.
3. **Primary users** — who uses this and why (one sentence).
4. **Tech stack line** — bold, formatted as: `Language X.Y / Framework Z / Database / Key UI libs`

Example:
```markdown
# My App

A billing dashboard for operations teams to track invoice status and payment timelines.

**Tech stack:** Ruby 3.3 / Rails 8 / PostgreSQL 16 / Hotwire / Tailwind CSS
```

Do not include marketing language, badges, or aspirational descriptions. State what the app does today.

### 1.4 Third-Party Packages

The README must include a table of key third-party dependencies grouped by category. Each entry needs:

| Column | Required | Description |
| ------ | -------- | ----------- |
| Gem/Package | Yes | Name, linked to the project's GitHub or homepage |
| Purpose | Yes | One-line description of what it does in this project |
| Docs | Yes | Link to official documentation (not just the GitHub README if better docs exist) |

Group packages by category. Recommended categories:

- Application (framework, server, assets, templates)
- Background Jobs & Caching
- Authentication & Authorization
- HTTP & Integrations
- Error Tracking & Deployment
- Testing
- Code Quality

Rules:
- Include all gems/packages that a developer would need to understand to work on the project.
- Omit standard library and obvious framework internals (e.g., `bundler`, `rake`, `activesupport`).
- Omit infrastructure-only gems that developers never interact with directly (e.g., `bootsnap`, `tzinfo-data`) unless they have meaningful configuration.

### 1.5 Production Section

The production section must cover:

1. **Build command** — how to build the production Docker image.
2. **Image details** — note multi-stage build, excluded gem groups, non-root user, etc.
3. **Deployment target** — where the app is deployed.
4. **Environment tiers** — table of environments (production, staging, review) with purpose and deploy trigger.
5. **Secrets management** — how secrets are injected.
6. **Link to deployment docs** — reference `practices/deployment-strategy.md` or a project-specific deployment spec for full details.

If any of these are not yet configured, say so explicitly with a `> **Status:** Not yet configured.` callout. Do not omit the section — document the intended architecture even if it's not built yet.

### 1.6 README Anti-Patterns (Prohibited)

| Anti-Pattern | Problem |
| ------------ | ------- |
| "Run `rails s` to start the app" with no database setup | New developer gets an immediate error |
| Only documenting Docker Compose, not conventional path | Developers who prefer native tooling are blocked |
| Only documenting conventional path, not Docker Compose | Onboarding friction for developers without the runtime installed |
| Listing gems without documentation links | Developer has to search for docs themselves |
| Stale commands that no longer work | Worse than no README — actively misleading |
| Placeholder README from framework generator | Signals the project is not maintained |
| Including secrets or real credentials | Security risk, even in examples |
| Including CI badges, code coverage shields, or marketing copy | Noise that obscures the useful content |

### 1.7 Maintenance

The README must be updated whenever:

- A new dependency is added to the project.
- The development setup process changes (new env vars, new services, etc.).
- The deployment target or environment tiers change.
- The authentication method changes.

Reviewer must check README accuracy when reviewing PRs that change dependency manifests, `docker-compose.yml`, `.env.example`, or deployment configuration.
